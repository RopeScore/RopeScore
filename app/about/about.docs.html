<h2 id="dash">1. The Dashboard</h2>
<img src="/static/img/docs/dash.png" />
<p>The above image shows a dashboard with multiple added categories.</p>
<p>The upper gray area is the menu, on the dashboard only "Dashboard" and "New Category"
  are avilable.</p>
<p>The first row of buttons gives you various tools manage your categories.</p>
<ul class="docs">
  <li><b><a href="#config">New</a></b>: This button will create a new category</li>
  <li><b>Import</b>: This button will allow you to choose an exportfile from ropescore,
    saved on your computer, and REPLACE ALL categories with those in the export file.
    Make sure to export your current categories before importing new ones</li>
  <li><b>Export</b>: This button will export all your data to a file on your computer,
    you will be prompted to select where the file should be saved</li>
  <li><b>Reset</b>: This button resets the program, it removes ALL saved data. It's highly
    reccomended to do an export before resetting</li>
  <li><b><a href="#live">Display Live Unofficial Scores</a></b>: This will take you to a page thatcan be
    displayed for instance on an external projector, it will show unofficial scores,
    live when they are set to be displayed in the program</li>
  <li><b><a href="#combine">Combine Two Categories</a></b>: Allows you to combine multiple categories
    into one</li>
  <li><b>Reset Category Order</b>: Resets the order the categories are displayed
    on the dashboard to be ordered by creation date, oldest first</li>
</ul>
<p>The row of buttons below "Dashboard" (here "Masters", "Teams" etc.) will, once clicked,
  open the category view for that particular category. The hexadecimal number below
  them are their checksum, more info on this is avilable under <a href="#event">Category</a></p>
<p>You can click the arrows (&lsaquo; and &rsaquo;) on the sides of every category to sort your Dashboard</p>



<h2 id="config">2. Configuration</h2>
<p>The configuration will open either when you create a new category from the menu or
  the dashboard, or when you click configure in the <a href="#event">Category view</a></p>
<p>Changing the configuration after scores have been entered may give unexpected results</p>

<h3 id="config.event">2.1 Category Data</h3>
<img src="/static/img/docs/config.png" />
<p>This is the configuration for a new category, in the Basics menu you must fill in
  a name for your category.</p>
<p>Simplified Levels will be described later.</p>
<p>Under Events you can select which events the category contains of by clicking the
  checkboxes to the right of their names. If an event is selected you must also specify
  how many judges that will judge the event.</p>
<img src="/static/img/docs/config-simplified.png" />
<p>If Simplified Leves are selected, the scores will be calculated a bit different,
  this is detailed under <a href="#result">Result</a>, the option to choose what
  factor the scores and ranks will be multiplied by to determine the final rank and
  score. If one of the fields is left blank the rank factors defined in fisac-irsf's
  judging manual will be used, and if it's an event that is not defined in fisac-irsf's
  judging manual and the field is left empty, a factor of one (1) will be used.</p>

<h3 id="config.part">2.2 Participants</h3>
<img src="/static/img/docs/participants.png" />
<p>Upon clicking "Save and Continue" on the <a href="#config.event">Category Data</a>  Configuration participants can be added, you have the option to select what id
  the participants will start with, this id is used for internal purposes, but is
  displayed as a tool for the Competition organiser. The id of a participant will
  never change, however the participant's name and club may, thus the id of the participant
  can be relied onto for identification.</p>
<img src="/static/img/docs/participants-added.png" />
<p>Once "Add Participants" has been clicked a table where the participants name and
  club can be entered will show, name and club can be omitted for every participant
  as the id is used by the program.</p>
<img src="/static/img/docs/participants-import.png" />
<p>Participants can also be imported from excel, or similar spreadsheet software. See
  <a href="/static/import-examples.xlsx" target="_blank" download="import-examples.xlsx">import-examples.xlsx</a>&nbsp;
  for examples. Note that the header id will be ignored, this is to ensure that ther
  won't be any conflicts. the data pasted into the input area will be treated as
  tab separated content (tsv) and every value must be separated by a tab character.</p>



<h2 id="event">3. Category</h2>
<img src="/static/img/docs/event.png" />
<p>After <a href="#config.part">adding participants</a> to a category, or when the category
  is clicked on <a href="#dash">The Dashboard</a> the Category View will be shown.
  This view gives an overview over the participants and the events, clicking "edit"
  in the column of an event on the row of a participant will open <a href="#score">Score Entering</a>.</p>
<p>Edit multiple is avilable for Speed events, where you can enter multiple speed scores
  at once</p>
<img src="/static/img/docs/checksums.png" />
<p>The checksums is a value calculated from the data entered, it can be compared to
  a second instance of RopeScore, if the two values match, then the entered data
  is equal</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Overall</b>: (green) The checksum in the top right corner of the category view
    grid shows the checksum for the whole category, this is also the number displayed
    on the
    <a href="#dash">Dashboard</a></li>
  <li><b>Participant</b>: (red) The checksum in the rightmost cell of every row shows
    the checksum of all data entered for that participant</li>
  <li><b>Event</b>: (blue) The checksum right to an Edit button shows the checksum for
    that participant's score in that specific event</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="score">4. Score Entering</h2>
<p>The view to enter scores does differ for speed events and freestyle events</p>
<p>For all numerical inputs both decimal point (.) and decimal comma (,) are allowed</p>

<h3 id="score.speed">4.1 Speed</h3>
<h4 id="score.speed.single">4.1.1 Single</h4>
<img src="/static/img/docs/score.png" />
<p>Enter the scores each speed judge have turned in to their respective box, if the
  speed judges have signaled that the skipper made a false start that box should
  be checked. For team speed, false switches is avilable, if the judges have marked
  any false switches, the appropriate number of false switches should be entered.
  The last row shows the unofficial score, calculated on the fly</p>

<h4 id="score.speed.mult">4.1.2 Multiple</h4>
<img src="/static/img/docs/score2.png" />
<p>Scores are entered the same way as for a single speed entry, however multiple participant's
  scores can be entered at once. The second-to-rightmost column shows the unofficial
  scores, calculated on the fly. pressing Display in the rightmost column will add
  that participant's speed score to the currently displayed speed events, see
  <a href="#live">Live Display</a>. Clicking display all will add all speed scores
  from the current event to the currently displayed speed events.
</p>

<h3 id="score.free">4.2 Freestyle</h3>
<img src="/static/img/docs/score1.png" />
<p><b>A</b> judges are Presentation Judges, <b>B</b> judges are Required Elements Judges,
  <b>D</b> judges are Difficulty Judges, <b>H</b> judges are Head judges, and
  <b>M</b> judges are Miss judges. The task of judging misses might be delegated
  to other judges, if so their miss counts are entered as a Miss judge's score</p>
<p>The program will correct numbers greater than the allowed amximum, and indicate sow
  by adding a yellow border to the input field, for five (5) seconds. If it can't
  automatically correct it, a red border will be added to the input field and saving
  won't be allowed.</p>
<p>it is highly reccomended that zero (0) is entered instead of leaving a field blank</p>
<p>The bottom row calculates and displays Unofficial scores on the fly.</p>
<p>Pressing Display will display that participant's score only on the live display,
  see <a href="#live">Live Display</a></p>



<h2 id="result">5. Results</h2>
<img src="/static/img/docs/results.png" />
<p>Results and ranking are generated for every event where a participant have complete
  scores entered. If all the events of a participant have complete scores entered
  the total score, rank sum and overall rank will be calculated as well. the overall
  score is calculated using the scores for the individual events multiplied by certain
  factors, see <a href="#config.event">Category Configuration</a></p>
<p>The Results can be exported to excel by pressing the "Export to Excel" button.</p>
<p>The "Update Live" will recalculate the scores every five (5) seconds until disabled</p>
<p>If simplified levels are selected in the category's <a href="#config.event">Configuration</a>&nbsp;
  the difficluties awards higher points per trick and the factors that the ranks
  and scores are multiplied against may differ from fisac-irsf's judging manual,
  as set in the <a href="#config.event">category Configuration</a>.</p>



<h2 id="live">6. Live Display</h2>
<p>It's reccommended to open up a live display in a separate window, see
  <a href="#misc.key">Keyboard Shortcuts</a>, also avilable via the "Window" menu</p>
<p>Controlling what is currently displayed is controlled from the
  <a href="#score">Score Entering</a></p>

<h3 id="live.speed">6.1 Speed</h3>
<img src="/static/img/docs/live.png" />

<h3 id="live.free">6.2 Freestyle</h3>
<img src="/static/img/docs/live1.png" />



<h2 id="combine">7. Category Combining</h2>
<p>Multiple categories can be combined into one by clicking the "Combine Two Categories"
  button on the <a href="#dash">Dashboard</a></p>
<img src="/static/img/docs/combine.png" />



<h2 id="misc">8. Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3 id="misc.key">8.1 Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
<ul class="docs">
  <li><b>Ctrl+N/&#x2318;+N</b>: Opens a new window, an aditional window can for example
    be used on a separate monitor to show results updated live.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="misc.bugs">8.2 Bugs</h3>
<p>See <a href="/bugreport">Bugs</a></p>
