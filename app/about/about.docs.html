<!-- BEGIN CONTENT -->
<h2 id="dash">1. The Dashboard</h2>
<img src="/static/img/docs/dash.png" />
<p>The above image shows a dashboard with multiple added events.</p>
<p>The upper gray area is the menu, on the dashboard only "Dashboard" and "New Event"
  are avilable.</p>
<p>The first row of buttons gives you various tools manage your events.</p>
<ul class="docs">
  <li><b>New</b>: This button will create a new event</li>
  <li><b>Import</b>: This button will allow you to choose an exportfile from ropescore,
    saved on your computer, and REPLACE ALL events with those in the export file.
    Make sure to export your current events before importing new ones</li>
  <li><b>Export</b>: This button will export all your data to a file on your computer,
    you will be prompted to select where the file should be saved</li>
  <li><b>Save</b>: This button saves your data, it doesn't currently have any effect
    as the data is saved regularly during normal use</li>
</ul>
<p>The row of buttons below "Dashboard" (here "test1", "Test2" etc.) will, once clicked,
  open the event view for that particular event.</p>



<h2 id="config">2. Configuration</h2>
<p>The configuration will open either when you create a new event from the menu or the
  dashboard, or when you click configure in the <a href="#event">Event view</a></p>
<p>Changing the configuration after scores have been entered may give unexpected results</p>

<h3 id="config.event">2.1 Event Data</h3>
<img src="/static/img/docs/config.png" />
<p>This is the configuration for a new event, in the Basics menu you must fill in a
  name for your event.</p>
<p>Simplified Levels will be described later.</p>
<p>Under Events you can select which subevents the Event contains of by clicking the
  checkboxes to the right of their names. If an event is selected you must also specify
  how many judges that will judge the event.</p>
<img src="/static/img/docs/config-simplified.png" />
<p>If Simplified Leves are selected, the scores will be calculated a bit different,
  this is detailed under <a href="#result">Result</a>, the option to choose what
  factor the scores and ranks will be multiplied by to determine the final rank and
  score. If one of the fields is left blank the rank factors defined in fisac-irsf's
  judging manual will be used, and if it's an event that is not defined in fisac-irsf's
  judging manual and the field is left empty, a factor of one (1) will be used.</p>

<h3 id="config.part">2.2 Participants</h3>
<img src="/static/img/docs/participants.png" />
<p>Upon clicking "Save and Continue" on the <a href="#config.event">Event Data</a> Configuration
  participants can be added, you have the option to select what id the participants
  will start with, this id is used for internal purposes, but is displayed as a tool
  for the event organiser. The id of a participant will never change, however the
  participant's name and club may, thus the id of the participant can be relied onto
  for identification.</p>
<img src="/static/img/docs/participants-added.png" />
<p>Once "Add Participants" has been clicked a table where the participants name and
  club can be entered will show, name and club can be omitted for every participant
  as the id is used by the program.</p>
<img src="/static/img/docs/participants-import.png" />
<p>Participants can also be imported from excel, or similar spreadsheet software. See
  <a href="/static/import-examples.xlsx" target="_blank" download="import-examples.xlsx">import-examples.xlsx</a>&nbsp;
  for examples. Note that the header id will be ignored, this is to ensure that ther
  won't be any conflicts. the data pasted into the input area will be treated as
  tab separated content (tsv) and every value must be separated by a tab character.</p>



<h2 id="event">3. Event</h2>
<img src="/static/img/docs/event.png" />
<p>After <a href="#config.part">adding participants</a> to an event, or when the event
  is clicked on <a href="#dash">The Dashboard</a> the Event View will be shown. This
  view gives an overview over the participants and the events, clicking "edit" in
  the column of an event on the row of a participant will open <a href="#score">Score Entering</a></p>



<h2 id="score">4. Score Entering</h2>
<p>The view to enter scores does differ for speed events and freestyle events</p>
<h3 id="score.speed">4.1 Speed</h3>
<img src="/static/img/docs/score.png" />
<p>Enter the scores each speed judge have turned in to their respective box, if the
  speed judges have signaled that the skipper made a false start that box should
  be checked.</p>

<h3 id="score.free">4.2 Freestyle</h3>
<img src="/static/img/docs/score1.png" />
<p><b>A</b> judges are Presentation Judges, <b>B</b> judges are Required Elements Judges,
  <b>D</b> judges are Difficulty Judges, <b>H</b> judges are Head judges, and
  <b>M</b> judges are Miss judges. The task of judging misses might be delegated
  to other judges, if so their miss counts are entered as a Miss judge's score</p>
<p>Currently the program will fail silently if a number greater than the allowed max
  is entered, this might cause results for that participant to not be calculated.</p>
<p>it is highly reccomended that zero (0) is entered instead of leaving a field blank</p>


<h2 id="result">5. Results</h2>
<img src="/static/img/docs/results.png" />
<p>Results and ranking are generated for every subevent where a participant have complete
  scores entered. If all the subevents of a participant have complete scores entered
  the total score, rank sum and overall rank will be calculated as well. the overall
  score is calculated using the scores for the individual subevents multiplied by
  certain factors, see <a href="#config.event">Event Configuration</a></p>
<p>The Results can be exported to excel by pressing the "Export to Excel" button.</p>
<p>The "Update Live" will recalculate the scores every second (1) until disabled</p>
<p>If simplified levels are selected in the event's <a href="#config.event">Configuration</a>&nbsp;
  the difficluties awards higher points per trick and the factors that the ranks
  and scores are multiplied against may differ from fisac-irsf's judging manual,
  as set in the <a href="#config.event">Event Configuration</a>.</p>



<h2 id="misc">6. Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3 id="misc.key">6.1 Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
<ul class="docs">
  <li><b>Ctrl+N/&#x2318;+N</b>: Opens a new window, an aditional window can for example
    be used on a separate monitor to show results updated live.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="misc.bugs">6.2 Bugs</h3>
<p>See <a href="/bugreport">Bugs</a></p>
<h3 id="misc.update">6.3 Updates</h3>
<p>The program will automatically search for and download updates when it is started,
  if there is an update avilable the program will prompt the user before installing.</p>
